                        I fell in love with writing code at a young age because i wanted to be able to build
                        my own video games, at that time i just wanted to be able to create my own snake, tetris, sonic
                        or super mario so i began to do some research on the web and there i read about how to get started
                        with python for dummies which led me to writing a lot of really simple 2D games in pygame 
                        around my high school years. In college i started a side hustle of building websites which 
                        at the time was mostly business profiles for local small businesses and non governmental
                        organizations.. ever since those days then
                        i have been doing a lot of freelance works while also trying to find more interesting projects
                        to collaborate on.. I've always had the curiosity and desire to build random stuff and very much 
                        enjoy the process of putting the pieces together. My organization and attention to detail are 
                        outstanding, 
                        but my main strength is in spotting problems and solving them, you can see some of my more creative
                        problem solving in my work. For more details about my experience and skills, download my  <a href="mds_cv.pdf" download>RESUME</a>
